# Java Function Invoker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/projectriff/java-function-invoker.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/projectriff/java-function-invoker)

## What It Does

The "Java Function Invoker" lets you concentrate on writing your business logic as a Java function while the invoker 
takes care of the rest that is needed to run your functions in a Kubernetes cluster with riff installed.
The invoker is a [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot) application that will locate your function in 
the JAR file you provide based on some configuration settings.
It will then expose the function over gRPC using riff's [streaming protocol](src/main/proto/riff-rpc.proto).
When used in a function service like [riff](https://projectriff.io/), the invoker boot application is provided by 
the platform when functions are built and basic request/reply http support is added via 
[the streaming/http adapter](http://github.com/projectriff/streaming-http-adapter-buildpack).

## How To Use It

### Function source

You need to configure a Maven or Gradle project for your function.
If you use Spring Boot then we recommend using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to bootstrap your project.
If you are not using Spring Boot for your function code then you need to create your own build configuration.

The [Spring Cloud Function](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-function/) project provides support for writing functions as part of a Spring Boot app.

#### Request-reply functions

The Java Function Invoker does not require any dependencies for simple request-reply functions. 
It only requires that your function implements the `java.util.function.Function` interface.

Example of a plain Java function:

```java
package functions;

import java.util.function.Function;

public class Upper implements Function<String, String> {

    public String apply(String name) {
        return name.toUpperCase();
    }
}
```

Example of a Spring Boot app with a function bean:

```java
package com.example.uppercase;

import java.util.function.Function;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

@SpringBootApplication
public class UppercaseApplication {

	@Bean
	Function<String, String> uppercase() {
		return s -> s.toUpperCase();
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(UppercaseApplication.class, args);
	}
}
```

#### Streaming functions

If you want to author a streaming function, you will also need to pull Reactor Core (`io.projectreactor:reactor-core`) as the invoker leverages Reactor's `Flux` API to work with streams.

```java
package functions;

import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

import java.util.function.Function;

public class Upper implements Function<Flux<String>, Flux<String>> {

    public String apply(Flux<String> names) {
        return names.map(String::length);
    }
}
```

If the function accepts several inputs and/or outputs, you can use the `Tuple` API of Reactor core. In the following example, the function accepts 2 input streams and 3 output streams:

```java
package io.projectriff.invoker.server;

import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;
import reactor.util.function.Tuple2;
import reactor.util.function.Tuple3;

import java.util.function.Function;

public class MultiInputOutputFunction implements Function<Tuple2<Flux<String>, Flux<Integer>>, 
                                                          Tuple3<Flux<String>, Flux<Boolean>, Flux<Integer>>> {
    
    @Override
    public Tuple3<Flux<String>, Flux<Boolean>, Flux<Integer>> apply(Tuple2<Flux<String>, Flux<Integer>> objects) {
        // [...]
    }
}
```


#### Function detection

Spring Cloud Function will attempt to detect the function from the function source.
If you have a single function declared with `@Bean` in a Spring Boot app then that is the function that will be used.
If you have multiple functions in the source then you have to specify which one you want using a bean name (see the next section).

If you have a Plain Java class with a function then you can provide a `Function-Class` entry in the JAR file manifest 
to indicate which function class to use or specify its class explicitly.
Here is an example of using a plug-in for Maven to add this information to the manifest:

```xml
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.0.2</version>
        <configuration>
          <archive>
            <manifestEntries>
              <Function-Class>functions.Greeter</Function-Class>
            </manifestEntries>
          </archive>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
```

#### Function handler

If your function can't be automatically detected then you need to provide a handler specification.
The simplest form of the handler is a bean name or a class name that can be instantiated (with a default constructor).
More complex creation scenarios can be handled by giving the handler via configuration properties:

* `spring.cloud.function.location` the file path of a jar file containing the function class, Boot uber-jar or vanilla jar,
* `spring.cloud.function.function-class` is a class name,
* `spring.cloud.function.definition` is a bean name,


#### Function samples

We have sample application for 
[plain Java function](src/test/functions-sources/hundred-divider) 
and for [Spring Boot app with a function bean](src/test/functions-sources/repeater-as-bean).

### Cloud Native Buildpacks

[Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/) provide a higher-level abstraction for building apps compared to Dockerfiles.

The [riff project](https://github.com/projectriff/riff) provides its own 
[builder](https://github.com/projectriff/builder) that specifically targets building functions using the riff function invokers.

## How it Works

As long as the dependencies are included in the archive correctly, you can supply a `Function` with a wide range of input and output types.
The input or output types can be plain JDK classes, or POJOs defined in your archive, or `Message` 
(from `spring-messaging`) or `Publisher` (from `reactive-streams`) or `Flux` or `Mono` (from `reactor-core`).
Input and output types can also be reactor's `TupleX` classes, thus allowing multi I/O functions.
The `Message` type will give you access to header metadata in the incoming and outgoing messages.
POJOs are converted from incoming messages / to return values using the `Content-Type` header and the `expectedContentType` field value.
