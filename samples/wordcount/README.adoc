=== prerequisites

1. riff is deployed
2. the `riff` CLI is on your PATH
3. the java invoker is installed

    riff invokers apply -f https://github.com/projectriff/java-function-invoker/raw/master/java-invoker.yaml

4. the `topics` helper script is on your PATH
5. the working directory is `samples/wordcount`

=== compile the Java code and build the JAR

```
./mvnw clean package
```

=== create the function and its input topic

```
riff create java --input words --output counts --handler functions.Wordcount
```

=== publish messages and witness grouped counts

In a terminal window:
```
topics tail -n counts
```

In a different terminal window, in quick succession:
```
riff publish --input words --data Two
riff publish --input words --data One
riff publish --input words --data Two
```

You'll see output similar to the following:
```
 Content-Type["text/plain"]	timestamp["1519342606257"]{"one":1,"two":2}
```

=== delete the function and its input topic

```
riff delete --all
```
